# ML Analysis of Renewable Energy Demand and Weather Supply

This project analyzes U.S. energy demand and renewable energy supply (solar and wind) using machine learning. It aligns weather and demand data to identify underserved regions with investment potential.

## Goal
- Merge and align hourly weather, solar/wind generation, and demand data
- Identify temporal and geographic mismatches
- Use clustering and predictive models to support planning for solar/wind investment

## Setup
- TODO

## Data

[US Energy Information Administration](https://www.eia.gov/opendata/)
[NASA - The POWER Project](https://power.larc.nasa.gov/)

## Running The Code

## Methods

## Status
In progress.  Data generation, preprocessing and EDA underway.

## Analysis

## Future Considerations
